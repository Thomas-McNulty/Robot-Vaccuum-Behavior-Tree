COMP131 Assignemnt 1: Behavioral Tree
Author: Thomas McNulty

This is my implementation of a behavioral tree. It is ran by running tree.py 
(python3 tree.py) in terminal. It requests user input for the starting blackboard
conditions and properties of the behavioral tree and then runs as many evaluations as
the user requests. It continues requesting the user until 0 cycles are requested. 

Each node requires a name. Running status is interprited as having the nodes name
in the blackboard, therefore names should be unique for each node. 

To test the program, alterations can be made to running times, delays, failure percentages,
and other available node parameters. Additionally, small scale trees can be created and ran
in tree.py by swapping the initial node for a new initial node (inside if __name__ == "__main__").
